# Code Bogging; I'm Almost There


This is a regular post, in my `spinosa.github.io` repository (which is now pointed to by [thecodeistheblog.com](thecodeistheblog.com)!).  It lives under `/_posts` with the filename `2013-07-22-getting-closer.md` (if you don't believe me, [check the repo](https://github.com/spinosa/spinosa.github.io)).

It should be getting processed by jekyll.

I set the layout to "post", but am assuming that won't do anything; I don't have jekyll and templates set up yet.


No matter, I have three immediate goals with this post

1.  See if it works at all (ie. I can visit [http://thecodeistheblog.com/])
2.  Display a index of all posts in the sidebar of my template (filled in with this)
3.  Create a followup post which is actually just a symlink to the index.html file in my "post repository"

While my new "code blogging" workflow isn't terribly complicated (once you have it set up), I will certainly want a few scripts to automate a few things.  For example, once I've created a new repository and it's ready to be posted, I'll want a script to do the rest of the hard work.  


It occurred to me that the above script could be used by anybody with a code blog setup similar to mine.  The script is essentially re-(code)blogging the "post repo" into my "container repo".  That's pretty interesting.


That's enough [rambling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKVp-atyiVA), time to post and get on with my experiments!
